# Homelessness in Washington State
I decided to search and create a word cloud about homelessness in Washington state because from an international student's perspective, there is a lot of homeless people in Seattle to the point that it is concerning. This got me wondering if this is a only happening in Seattle, or it is happening all over Washington State.
## Parameters for searching
- **Search Word**: Homeless, **Date**: 2023-1-15
- - These two terms were fixed for finding out my question. There wasn't really an option for date since I only had access
to data that was one week prior from today
- **Locations**: I chose to look at Seattle, Bellevue, Olympia, Tacoma, and Puyallup
- - I chose these cities because first, I am trying to compare Seattle to other cities, Bellevue because it is right next
to Seattle, Olympia since it is the capitol of Washington State, Tacoma and Puyallup because they are inbetween Seattle
and Olympia.
- - I did not want to go too far east because I thought cities there would have a very different atmosphere from Seattle,
and I did not know those places well.

## Comparison
First of all, there was a massive difference in the number of tweets between the cities that I have gathered data from. Seattle had the most tweets including the word 'homeless', and the number of tweets decreased as the distance from Seattle increased. Additionally, it was interesting to see how most locations outside of Seattle included the world 'Seattle' in its word cloud (shown in figure 1 and 2 below). 

I believe the reason for this difference is because homelessness is common in Seattle, and is not as a big problem in other cities outside of Seattle. This is exactly the pattern that I expected. I expected Seattle to be the city with most homelessness, and it is shown in the number of tweets including the word homeless. 

In the future, I could improve my research by altering the search words so that other cities would also have more results. Additionally, I could have picked cities outside of Washington to compare with other main cities in other States to compare in a higher level.

The point that standed out to me is the fact that Seattle was mentioned in other cities' tweets. This was interesting to me since this means that other cities are also worried about the homelessness problem in Seattle.
