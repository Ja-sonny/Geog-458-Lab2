# Homelessness in Washington State
I decided to search and create a word cloud about homelessness in Washington state because from an international student's
perspective, there is a lot of homeless people in Seattle to the point that it is concerning. This got me wondering if
this is a only happening in Seattle, or it is happening all over Washington State.
## Parameters for searching
- **Search Word**: Homeless, **Date**: 2023-1-15
- - These two terms were fixed for finding out my question. There wasn't really an option for date since I only had access
to data that was one week prior from today
- **Locations**: I chose to look at Seattle, Bellevue, Olympia, Tacoma, and Puyallup
- - I chose these cities because first, I am trying to compare Seattle to other cities, Bellevue because it is right next
to Seattle, Olympia since it is the capitol of Washington State, Tacoma and Puyallup because they are inbetween Seattle
and Olympia.
- - I did not want to go too far east because I thought cities there would have a very different atmosphere from Seattle,
and I did not know those places well.
